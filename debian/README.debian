--------------

To read the docs try

Specific thanks go out to Joy (Josip Rodin) <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>
for help with some various Debianisms.

To use the cronolog logging facilities, the following changes must be made:

1) install cronolog
2) edit /etc/boa/boa.conf to use the cronolog logging
3) comment out everything in /etc/logrotate.d/boa pre-pending a 
   '#' character to each line.  This is very important!
4) move the old log files out of the way before restarting Boa

NOTE: Cronolog does *not* rotate files in the traditional way.
